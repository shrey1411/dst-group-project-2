    "# Ongoing Research on the sources of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, I will document ongoing research into establishing our project domain and selecting an appropriate dataset to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly discussed in class that the group members were interested in implimenting Neural Network technology with an emphasis on its role in image classification so this is where I focused the majorirty of my inital research. Below I will list various datasets that could be utilised for a project like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Classification Datatsets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "  Small image datasets (10 and 100 classes, respectively) often used for image classification tasks. This could be implimented for training and testing CNN's\n",
    "\n",
    "available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ImageNet\n",
    "\n",
    "A large-scale dataset with over 14 million labeled images .ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a \"synonym set\" or \"synset\". There are more than 100,000 synsets in WordNet; the majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly labeled and sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.\n",

    "available at: https://image-net.org/about.php\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flowers-102\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset of 8,189 images of flowers, covering 102 flower categories. Each class has between 40 and 258 images. this could be good for testing fine-grained classification, especially for transfer learning with pretrained CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "available at: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102\n",
    "\n",
    "#### animals 10\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of images of 10 different animals, such as cats, dogs, elephants, and lions, making it an excellent choice for multi-class classification. This would goof for image classification and performing LRP.\n",
    "\n",
    "available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EUROSTATE\n",

    "A dataset of satellite images from Sentinel-2, covering 10 different classes such as residential, industrial, forest, and water.\n",

    "All group members expressed a degree of interest in applications of neural network technology within a medical diagnosis framework. Below I suggest some high-level ideas we could potentially frame our project around should we focus on medical applications of the NN:\n",

    "\n",
    "Task 1: Brain Tumor Segmentation in mpMRI scans.\n",
    "-\tThe participants are called to address this task by using the provided clinically-acquired training data to develop their method and produce segmentation labels of the different glioma sub-regions. The sub-regions considered for evaluation are the \"enhancing tumor\" (ET), the \"tumor core\" (TC), and the \"whole tumor\" (WT) [see figure below]. The ET is described by areas that show hyper-intensity in T1Gd when compared to T1, but also when compared to “healthy” white matter in T1Gd. The TC describes the bulk of the tumor, which is what is typically resected. The TC entails the ET, as well as the necrotic (NCR) parts of the tumor. The appearance of NCR is typically hypo-intense in T1-Gd when compared to T1. The WT describes the complete extent of the disease, as it entails the TC and the peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue (ED), which is typically depicted by hyper-intense signal in FLAIR.\n",
    "-\tThe provided segmentation labels have values of 1 for NCR, 2 for ED, 4 for ET, and 0 for everything else.\n"
